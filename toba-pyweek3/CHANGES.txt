+ cracked claw case
+ smoke from trash
+ fire in bar

* show only one dialog line at a time (newer one, resets older ones)
* sudden jumping of the screen on entrance, must fix
+ play music
- blah blah blah

= not sure what this file is for ===================

- extra mace appears when smashing machine
- 5 nibbles per level
- nibbles game screen should fill screen
- cards should be on a wood background or something...- give grog to patron1 doesn't work

= beta 4 (Thursday) ==============================

- can't give lady cloak
- got cloak kept skull
- got chicken kept coins
- cards and mace disappear before you *actually* get them
- you can lose items if you walk out of a room while you have an item in hand
- nibbles might be too long (3)

= beta 3 (Wednesday) ==============================

- have text clear when you play a game...
- winning at cards .. does nothing
- redundant text in magic shop nag
- added card game, nibbles
* you can, if you try, get more than 9 items
- after asking for a cloak in magic, it sends you to :top, not the topic..
- text a bit slower

= beta 2 (Tuesday evening) =========================

+ proof read text for high humor/quality factor
+ mean while back with lord tarbukas .. after each element
+ make getting fire puzzle more obvious -- another item should be burnable
    like a stick in the swamp that you burn.
+ add in lots of mace-abuse responses.
+ grog on arcade guy response.. maybe 

* swamp = s/at least/at last
* text in magic (2nd nag too long)
* look fire 
* walk to x is junk fix it :)
* skull re-appears in the swamp

= beta 1 (Tuesday afternoon) =====================
