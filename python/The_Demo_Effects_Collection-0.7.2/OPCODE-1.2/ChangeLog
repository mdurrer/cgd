01-28-2003 Added a check to the configure script for the compiler version. 
Compiling the file OPC_TreeCollider.cpp with gcc >= 3.0 and optimization -O2 results in run-time errors.
At the moment it is not clear if this is an OPCODE bug or a gcc bug.
Therefore when configure encounters gcc >= 3.0, the file is compiled with -O1.
Older versions of gcc compile the file with -O2.
