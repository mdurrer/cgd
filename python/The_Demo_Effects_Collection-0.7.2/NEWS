04-29-03 TDEC's plugin system can now add effects defined in for instance a database or in a script by using a 
parameter list to init effects. New effect and filter plugins were added to demonstrate the ease of implementation.
Bugs were fixed, overall functionality was improved.
Check out the improved MULTILAYER demo to see the latest powerfull features of TDEC's plugin system in action.
03-11-03 TDEC has been extended with a run-time pluggable multi-layered demo effects plugin system, which is 
able to show a lot of effects, filters and transition plugins concurrently and can be used to create demo's. 
This is now part of libTDEC. Plugins can be found in the PLUGINS directory. 
Check out the new MULTILAYER demo to see the system in action.
