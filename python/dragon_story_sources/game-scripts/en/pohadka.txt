D: "It's a fairy tale unlike any other."
D: "A dragon came and was going to eat the princess.
    Fortunately, a brave prince appeared."
D: "He killed the dragon, married the princess
    and was given half of the kingdom.
    They all lived happily until they died."

D: "The old idiotic king had already lost
    all of his teeth
    and could only eat shakes."
D: "His skin dried out completely
    and he was as light as parchment."
D: "No wonder that, when his servant had forgotten
    to close the window, the king flew away.
    There's a draft in old castles, you know."
D: "The king blew in the wind for a while,
    but it didn't last too long.
    He was finally soaked by a rain shower."

D: "The dragon was eaten by worms.
    The prince was promoted to be king
    of the second half of the kingdom."
D: "The Princess became the Queen..
    Alas, they had no children."
D: "We'll call them Prince and Princess
    not to get them confused."
D: "The Princess lost her young appearance soon
    and her face became full of wrinkles."
D: "One day when she had a look in the mirror,
    she hated what she saw and threw it in a rage.
    The mirror was broken into many shards."

    because the other one was made of glass.
    He didn't see well and stepped on the shards
    with his bare feet."

D: "He got blood-poisoning
    and died in a horrible fever."
D: "He had also suffered from rheumatism,
    because of walking barelegged."

D: "A new dragon came and was going to have
    something to eat."
D: "The Princess was now old and ugly,
    and no young suitors appeared to defend her."
D: "The dragon was greedy
    and stuffed the whole princess into his mouth.
    He proceeded to choke to death
    because she was too tough."

D: "No wonder, since old meat is to be
    simmered and roasted first."
D: "Any other dragon would rather
    die of hunger than to
    gulp such a mouthful."
D: "As soon as the dragons heard of it,
    none of them came there anymore."
