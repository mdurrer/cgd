<h2><a name="Introduction" id="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
The Julia Set and Mandelbrot Set are those quite well known sets on
the complex plane that create those pretty infinitely detailed
images. They're so pretty, that there is even art created with
them. The Mandelbrot Set isn't a real fractals by definition, but
it's semi self similar and still shows infinite detail, so it's
usually called a fractal as well.<br />
<br />
Research on Julia Sets was done in 1917 by Gaston Julia himself,
but he didn't have a computer available to actually draw it. The
topic didn't gain much interest, until in the 1970s, Benout
Mandelbrot drew Julia Sets on a computer, and discovered the
Mandelbrot set.<br />
<br />
This tutorial will only cover the basics of the theory (there's
much more to tell about the Julia and Mandelbrot sets), and the
code to draw them. Apart from that, more code is included of some
pretty handy fractal viewers where you can zoom and move around on
the fly.<br />
<h2><a name="Julia_Set" id="Julia_Set"></a>Julia Set</h2>
This chapter first tries to explain a bit of the mathematical
formulas behind Julia Sets, more specifically, Quadratic Julia
Sets. Knowledge about complex numbers is required, so if you need
it you can read the appendix about complex numbers.
<p>So how to generate such a beautiful fractal? In short:
<span style="font-style: italic;">for every pixel, iterate znew =
zold&sup2; + c on the complex plane until it leaves the circle
around the origin with radius 2. The number of iterations it the
color of the pixel.</span><br /></p>
<p>The screen will be representing a part of the complex plane,
inside the circle with radius 2 around the origin. For a pixel, the
x coordinate will represent the real part of it's complex
coordinates, and the y coordinate will be the imaginary part.</p>
<p>For a julia set, for each pixel apply an iterated complex
function. This function is newz = oldz&sup2; + c, with z and c both
being complex numbers. Z is initially the coordinates of the pixel,
and will then constantly be updated through every iteration: each
iteration, the "newz" of the previous iteration is now used as
"oldz".<br /></p>
<p>If you keep iterating this function, depending on the initial
condition (the pixel), z will either go to infinity, or remain in
the circle with radius 2 around the origin of the complex plane
forever. The points that remain in the circle forever, are the ones
that belong to the Julia Set. So keep iterating the function until
the distance of z to the origin (0,0) is greater than 2. Also give
a maximum number of iterations, for example 256, or the computer
would be stuck in an endless loop.<br /></p>
<p>The color value of the pixel will then become the number of
times we had to iterate the function before the distance of z to
the origin got larger than 2. The constant c in the formula can be
anything really, as long as it's also inside the circle with radius
2. Different values of c give different Julia Sets. Some Julia Sets
are connected, others aren't. The Mandelbrot Set is the collection
of all&nbsp; points c that generate a connected Julia
Set.<br /></p>
Here's an example of the calculations:
<p>First, you can choose a constant c for the function, which one
you choose will determinate the shape of the fractal. Let's take c
= (-0.5,0.5) in this example, so -0.5 is the real part and 0.5 the
imaginary part.<br /></p>
<p>Imagine we're currently calculating the color of pixel (256,192)
on a 256*256 screen. First, we transform the coordinates so it lies
between -1 and 1 (if you zoom or move around in the fractal a
different transformation is required): the coordinates become
(1,0.5) so p = 1 + 0.5i.</p>
<p>Now we apply the function for the first time:</p>
<tt>z = p&sup2; +
c</tt><br />
<tt>&nbsp; = (1 + 0.5i)&sup2; -
0.5 + 0.5i</tt><br />
<tt>&nbsp; = 1 + 2*0.5i +
0.25*i&sup2; - 0.5 + 0.5i</tt><br />
<tt>&nbsp; = 0.5 + 1.5i -
0.25</tt><br />
<tt>&nbsp; = 0.25 +
1.5i</tt><br />
<p>So z = (0.25,1.5), and the distance of z to the origin =
sqrt(0.25*0.25 + 1.5*1.5) = 1.52069... is still smaller than
2.<br /></p>
<p>Now you take this calculated z and put it in the function again
to calculate the next z, so now we get<br /></p>
<tt>z = (0.25 + 1.5i)&sup2; - 0.5
+ 0.5i</tt><br />
<tt>&nbsp; = 0.0625 + 2*0.375i -
2.25 - 0.5 + 0.5i</tt><br />
<tt>&nbsp; = -2.6875 +
1.25i</tt><br />
<br />
The distance is now 8.78515625, so we're outside the circle with
radius 2, and we now know the point is outside the julia set. The
number of iterations was now only 2, so the pixel gets color value
2 and we're done.&nbsp; Some start values give more than 256
iterations, and depending on how much maximal iterations you've
set, you can then stop or keep continuing.<br />
<p>The more iterations, the more detailed the Julia set will look
when zooming in deeply, but the more calculations are needed. The
higher the precision of the numbers, the longer you can zoom in
without encountering blocky pixels.<br /></p>
Here's the source code of a program that'll draw a Julia Set. Put
this in the main.cpp file, inside the "<span style=
"font-family: monospace;">int main(int argc, char *argv[])</span>"
function. The comments in it are made blue and explain most of the
code. The code doesn't use complex numbers but normal floating
point numbers, the real and imaginary part are simply calculated
separately, like you'd do by hand.<br />

The parameter of the number of iterations is used for the "Hue" of
the HSV color model. The advantage of Hue is that it's circular, so
no matter how many maximum iterations there are, the Hue based
color palette will always keep generating nice continuous
values.<br />
<br />
The result looks like this:<br />

You can change the values "zoom", "moveX" and "moveY" in the above
code to zoom in at certain positions, but much better would be if
you could do this in realtime while the program is running, for
example by pressing the arrow keys to move, and the keypad + and -
keys to zoom in/out. Even better would be if you could use the
keypad arrow keys to change the values of cRe and cIm to change the
shape of the Julia Set in realtime.<br />
<br />
Programming something that can do that is pretty simple, just use
the SDL keys to change the values of those variables and draw the
Julia Set every time again in a loop! The following code does all
that and&nbsp; also shows the values of all those variables on
screen, so that you know exactly at what coordinates of the Julia
Set the nice things are. It'll also let you change the value
"maxIterations" etc... The comments in the code should explain it
all again. There isn't any new computer graphics code, just input
keys that change parameters:<br />

Now you can explore all the details of every possible Julia Set!
Find a nice shape with the keypad numbers, then move with the arrow
keys to a border or interesting spot of the julia set, and start
zooming in to see more detail. If you've zoomed in, you may want to
press the numpad "*" button to see more detail.<br />
<br />
Note: in the current version of gcc, the pow function doesn't work
if you mix floats and doubles, so make sure either everything is
double, or everything is float.<br />
<br />
Here are some screenshots:<br />

<h2><a name="Mandelbrot_Set_" id="Mandelbrot_Set_"></a>Mandelbrot
Set<br /></h2>
When zooming in, you'll keep seeing the same details over and over
in a Julia Set - it's a fractal after all. The Mandelbrot set isn't
completely self similar, it's only semi self similar, so in a
Mandelbrot set much more surprises can turn up when zooming
in.<br />
<br />
The mandelbrot set represents every complex point c for which the
Julia Set will be connected, or every Julia Set that contains the
origin. To generate a mandelbrot set you use the same iterative
function as the Julia Set, only this time c will represent the
position of the pixel, and z will start at (0,0)<br />
<br />
The following code is very similar to the Julia Set drawer, only
it'll output a Mandelbrot Set with rainbow palette instead. The
changed parts are indicated in bold.<br />

By moving around and zooming you can get very pretty pictures here.
The parameter values were left on the pictures so you can see the
coordinates, the zoom level and number of maximum iterations to
generate those pictures:<br />
<br />
This part of the Mandelbrot Set is called the Seahorse
Valley:<br />
<img alt="" src="images/mandelbrotseahorse.jpg" style=
"width: 319px; height: 238px;" /> <img alt="" src=
"images/mandelbrot1.jpg" style=
"width: 319px; height: 238px;" /><br />
<br />
A deeper zoom to the size of the Seahorse Valley (zoomed in 1779
times):<br />
<img alt="" src="images/mandelbrot2.jpg" style=
"width: 319px; height: 240px;" /><br />
<br />
A detail on the other side of the set:<br />
<img alt="" src="images/mandelbrot3.jpg" style=
"width: 319px; height: 239px;" /><br />
<br />
A few "minibrots", the first zoomed in only 8463 times, the second
zoomed in 419622325484 times! Such minibrots only become visible if
you allow enough iterations.<br />
<img alt="" src="images/mandelbrot4.jpg" style=
"width: 319px; height: 240px;" /> <img alt="" src=
"images/mandelbrot5.jpg" style=
"width: 319px; height: 239px;" /><br />
<br />
This is the effect of using more iterations: on the right is the
same picture on the left, but with twice as much maximum
iterations:<br />
<img alt="" src="images/mandelbrot6.jpg" style=
"width: 320px; height: 239px;" /> <img alt="" src=
"images/mandelbrot7.jpg" style=
"width: 319px; height: 240px;" /><br />
<br />
This is a deep zoom with a very high number of iterations in the
side of the elephant valley. The elephant valley is the pointy
shape on the X-axis, on right side of the mandelbrot.<br />
<img alt="" src="images/mandelbrot9.jpg" style=
"width: 319px; height: 240px;" /><br />
<br />
This picture is added more recently, because it's pretty
pretty:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/mandelbrotpretty.png" style=
"width: 320px; height: 240px;" /><br />
<br />
And here's a picture that's zoomed in so much, that the numerical
limit of 64-bit floating point numbers was reached. It starts
looking blocky. It's zoomed in more than 10^18 times though, for
deeper detail, processors with higher precision, or emulation of
infinite precision numbers is required:<br />
<img alt="" src="images/mandelbrot8.jpg" style=
"width: 319px; height: 239px;" /><br />
<br />

to a Mandelbrot Set of 1280*1024 pixels.<br />
