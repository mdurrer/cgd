<h2><a name="Introduction" id="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
This is a very short tutorial, about the very classic Fire Effect,
and creating a fire color palette for it. Maybe this article will
be extended later with fire made by particles or other better
looking fires.
<h2><a name="The_Classic_Fire_Effect" id="The_Classic_Fire_Effect"></a>The Classic Fire Effect</h2>
This fire effect has been used quite often for java demos, oldskool
demos, etc... It's very easy to program, and gives very neat
looking fire.<br />
<br />
First you have to create a palette, typically of 256 colors, but it
can be any other amount as well here because we emulate it. With
the HSLtoRGB function it's easy to create a good palette, select a
hue range from red to yellow, keep saturation at 255, and
brightness from 0 to 255 so that more red colors become darker as
well. The palette is created to be used with the drawBuffer
function, so the RGB colors are stored in a single integer value in
BGR order.<br />
<br />
To contain the fire, you need a buffer (called fire[][] here) with
the same size as the screen. In a graphics mode that uses a
palette, this buffer can be the screen itself, but here we use RGB
mode and the palette is emulated. The buffer starts with every
pixel at 0. Then at the bottom row, give a random value to each
pixel, and keep changing the random values every frame. Each frame,
calculate each row of pixels based on the two rows below it: the
value of each pixel, becomes the sum of the 3 pixels below it (one
directly below it, one to the left of this one, and one to the
right of this one), and one pixel directly two rows below it. Then
divide the sum through a value slightly larger than 4, so that the
fire dies out as it rises. The larger the value you divide it
through, the lower the flames can rise. For example, if you use
*16, /65, which is the same as dividing through 4.0625, the flames
will rise higher than if you use *4, /17, which is the same as
dividing through 4.25. If you divide it though 4, the fire keeps
rising forever, and if you divide it though 5, it dies out way to
fast.<br />
<br />
This image shows which pixels are included in the calculation: the
pixel with the cross is the current pixel, and the 4 green pixels
are the ones used to calculate the value of the current
pixel.<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/firepixel.gif" style="width: 115px; height: 115px;" /><br />
<br />
Do this from top to bottom, if you do the calculations in the wrong
order, some pixels will already be recalculated while other pixels
that depend on them still have to be calculated. Each new frame may
depend only on the values of the previous frame. The top of the
screen has y-coordinate 0, and the bottom has y-coordinate
h-1.<br />
<br />
On the sides of the screen, the pixels have no neighbors to the
left or right anymore, and to overcome this, the effect can be made
circular so that the rightmost pixel has the leftmost pixel as it's
neighbor and vica versa. For this, modulo division through the
width of the screen can be used on the x-coordinate of the
neighbors.<br />
<br />
The version of the effect here isn't very fast at high resolutions,
but there's still set a maximum number of frames per second by
using the waitFrame function, so that it won't run too fast on
faster computers in the future.<br />
<br />
Because we have a fire buffer, we can use the drawBuffer function
instead of drawing each pixel separately, which is much faster. The
buffer that gets drawn isn't the same as the fire array though,
because that one has values from 0 to 256, which gives the wrong
colors. Instead we create a new buffer and store the RGB color
gotten from the palette in it, and then draw this buffer (which
also has the name "buffer" here).<br />
<br />
Put the following code inside the the main.cpp file. The comments in the code will explain a bit more:<br />
<br />
<center>
<table class="codetable"><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;"><pre><span class="code">#include &lt;cmath>
#include &lt;string>
#include &lt;vector>
#include &lt;iostream>

#include "quickcg.h"
using namespace QuickCG;

//define the width and height of the screen and the buffers
const int screenWidth = 640;
const int screenHeight = 128;

Uint32 fire[screenWidth][screenHeight];  //this buffer will contain the fire
Uint32 buffer[screenWidth][screenHeight];  //this is the buffer to be drawn to the screen
Uint32 palette[256]; //this will contain the color palette

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  //set up the screen
  screen(screenWidth, screenHeight, 0, "fire");
  
  //declarations
  ColorRGB color; //used during palette generation
  float time = getTime(), oldTime; //the time of this and the previous frame, for timing
  
  //make sure the fire buffer is zero in the beginning
  for(int x = 0; x &lt; w; x++)
  for(int y = 0; y &lt; h; y++)
  fire[x][y] = 0;
  
  //generate the palette
  for(int x = 0; x &lt; 256; x++)
  {
    //HSLtoRGB is used to generate colors:
    //Hue goes from 0 to 85: red to yellow
    //Saturation is always the maximum: 255
    //Lightness is 0..255 for x=0..128, and 255 for x=128..255
    color = HSLtoRGB(ColorHSL(x / 3, 255, std::min(255, x * 2)));
    //set the palette to the calculated RGB value
    palette[x] = RGBtoINT(color);
  }
  
  //start the loop (one frame per loop)
  while(!done())
  {
    //timing: set to maximum 50 milliseconds per frame = 20 frames per second
    oldTime = time;
    waitFrame(oldTime, 0.05);
    time = getTime();
    
    //randomize the bottom row of the fire buffer
    for(int x = 0; x &lt; w; x++) fire[x][h - 1] = abs(32768 + rand()) % 256;
    //do the fire calculations for every pixel, from top to bottom
    for(int y = 0; y &lt; h - 1; y++)
    for(int x = 0; x &lt; w; x++)
    {
      fire[x][y] =
        ((fire[(x - 1 + w) % w][(y + 1) % h]
        + fire[(x) % w][(y + 1) % h]
        + fire[(x + 1) % w][(y + 1) % h]
        + fire[(x) % w][(y + 2) % h])
        * 32) / 129;
    }

    //set the drawing buffer to the fire buffer, using the palette colors
    for(int x = 0; x &lt; w; x++)
    for(int y = 0; y &lt; h; y++)
    {
      buffer[x][y] = palette[fire[x][y]];
    }
    
    //draw the buffer and redraw the screen
    drawBuffer(buffer[0]);
    redraw();
  }
}
</span></pre></td>

If you run it, first everything is black, and the flames rise two
pixels every frame until they reached their maximum height. Then
they'll still keep animating because the bottom is randomized every
frame:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/fire.jpg" style="width: 639px; height: 126px;" /><br />
<br />
If you don't randomize the bottom of the fire buffer every frame
but only at the beginning, the flames won't be animated either, and
once they have risen to their maximum height, they'll stay still
forever:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/firestill.jpg" style="width: 639px; height: 127px;" /><br />
<br />
By changing parameters, you can tweak the fire, for example this is
what I got for changing the calculations to:<br />
<br />
<center>
<table class="codetable">
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">
<pre>
<span class="code">fire[x][y]= ((fire[(x - 1) % w][(y + 1) % h]
            + fire[(x) % w][(y + 2) % h]
            + fire[(x + 1) % w][(y + 1) % h]
            + fire[(x) % w][(y + 3) % h])
            * 64) / 257;</span>
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<br />
Instead of randomizing the bottom row of pixels you can also
randomize the edges of objects, for example to make flaming text,
