<h2><a name="Introduction_" id=
"Introduction_"></a>Introduction<br /></h2>
There are quite a lot of fractals named after Waclaw Sierpinski, a
Polish mathematician who lived from 1882 to 1969.<br />
<br />
These include the Sierpinski Triangle, the Sierpinski Carpet, the
Sierpinski Pyramid (the 3D version of the Sierpinski Triangle) and
the Sierpinski Cube (the 3D version of the Sierpinski Carpet). The
2D figures will be described here.<br />
<h2><a name="Sierpinski_Triangle_" id=
"Sierpinski_Triangle_"></a>Sierpinski Triangle<br /></h2>
The Sierpinski Triangle, also called Sierpinski Gasket and
Sierpinski Sieve, can be drawn by hand as follows:<br />
<br />
Start with a single triangle. This is the only triangle in this
direction, all the others will be upside down:<br />
<img alt="" src="images/sierhand1.gif" style=
"width: 128px; height: 128px;" /><br />
<br />
Inside this triangle, draw a smaller upside down triangle. It's
corners should be exactly in the centers of the sides of the large
triangle:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/sierhand2.gif" style=
"width: 128px; height: 128px;" /><br />
<br />
Now, draw 3 smaller triangles in each of the 3 triangles that are
pointing upwards, again with the corners in the centers of the
sides of the triangles that point upwards:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/sierhand3.gif" style=
"width: 128px; height: 128px;" /><br />
<br />
Now there are 9 triangles pointing upwards. In each of these 9,
draw again smaller upside down triangles:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/sierhand4.gif" style=
"width: 128px; height: 128px;" /><br />
<br />
In the 27 triangles pointing upwards, again draw 27 triangles
pointing downwards:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/sierhand5.gif" style=
"width: 128px; height: 128px;" /><br />
<br />
Rinse, repeat.<br />
<br />
After infinite steps, and if all triangles pointing upwards would
be filled, you have the Sierpinski Sieve.<br />
<br />
Every step, more triangles have to be drawn. This is a recursive
process, and it can be drawn the same way with a computer.<br />
<br />
<h3><a name="With_Recursion_" id="With_Recursion_"></a>With
Recursion<br /></h3>
We'll now program that what was drawn by hand on the computer, by
making a triangle drawing function that'll call itself again 3
times, until n steps of recursions are reached. This program is
made so that it works for any initial triangle, it doesn't have to
be symmetrical, the only condition is that the corners lie inside
the screen.<br />
<br />
The main function sets up the screen and calls the drawSierpinski
function. The drawSierpinski function itself will draw only one
triangle: the initial one that points upwards. Then it'll call the
function subTriangle, and that is the actual recursive function,
that'll draw all the upside down triangles.<br />
<br />
The function subTriangle draws a single upside down triangle, with
the 3 corners you give it with it's parameters. Then it'll call
itself 3 times again, to draw 3 smaller triangles. For these 3
triangles, new corners are used of course, and these have to be
calculated. In the following image, if the black triangle is the
big triangle the subTriangle function has drawn, then the 3 red
triangles are the new ones that have to be calculated:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/siermath1.gif" style=
"width: 253px; height: 195px;" /><br />
<br />
The corners of the big triangle are a1, a2 and a3. The corners of
one of the smaller triangles are b1, b2 and b3 as you can see on
the image. If we see all these points as vectors, the the formulas
for the points b (with the points a being known) are:<br />
<br />
b3 = (a1 + a2) / 2, because b3 lies in the center between a1 and
a2, this point is the average of a1 and a2!<br />
<br />
b1 = b3 + (a1 - a3) / 2: if you examine well, you'll see that the
point b1 is the sum of the point b3 and the vector (a1 - a3) / 2,
it's divided through 2 because the corresponding side of the
smaller triangle is half as big.<br />
<br />
And finally,<br />
<br />
b2 = b3 + (a2 - a3) / 2: this is very similar to the other formula,
but with the other side.<br />
<br />
For the other 2 small triangles, something similar is done.<br />
<br />
In the code, we aren't using a vector class, so x and y are
separate variables, and because of the way vector additions work,
we simply have to do the same thing twice, once for x, and once for
y, with the same formulas.<br />
<br />
For the coordinates of triangle corners, floating point numbers are
used for more precision.<br />
<br />
With this knowledge the program can be made, the comments in the
code below will explain how it works:<br />

Here's what you see after running the program:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/sierpinskisieve.gif" style=
"width: 644px; height: 503px;" /><br />
<br />
<h3><a name="With_AND" id="With_AND"></a>With "AND"</h3>
The method given above is only one of the <span style=
"font-style: italic;">very</span> many ways to draw Sierpinski
Triangles. One of these ways is with the AND operator. If you take
of a pixel the x-coordinate as an integer, and the y-coordinate as
an integer, and use the AND operator on them, if the result is 0,
draw a pixel of one color, otherwise another. You'll then see a
Sierpinski Triangle pop up!<br />
<br />
The AND operator on two integers, takes both integers as a binary
number, and uses AND on each of the corresponding bits. The AND
operator on bits works as follows::<br />
<br />
<table style="width: 20%; text-align: left;" border="1"
cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">Operation<br /></td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">Result<br /></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">0 AND 0<br /></td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">0<br /></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">0 AND 1<br /></td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">0<br /></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">1 AND 0<br /></td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">0<br /></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">1 AND 1<br /></td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">1<br /></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br />
This is done for every bit of the integer, and only if the
resulting integer is in binary 0000000000000000, the pixel is given
another color.<br />
<br />
The code is a very simple double loop that goes through every pixel
and checks if x &amp; y is 0 or not, where "&amp;" is the binary
AND operator in C++. By using "x &amp; y" inside an if condition,
it'll only be false in the case x &amp; y is 0, and in all other
cases a white pixel is drawn, so the result will be a black
sierpinski triangle on a white background.<br />
<br />
<center>
<table class="codetable">
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">
<pre><span class="code">int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    screen(256, 256, 0, <span class="string">"AND"</span>);
    for(int x = 0; x &lt; w; x++)
    for(int y = 0; y &lt; h; y++)
    {
        if(x &amp; y) pset(x, y, RGB_White);
    }    
    redraw();
    sleep();
    return 0;
}</span></pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<br />
The result looks best if the screen sizes are powers of 2,
otherwise you see only a part of the triangle.<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/sierand.gif" style=
"width: 259px; height: 279px;" /><br />
<br />
<h3><a name="With_a_Random_Function_" id=
"With_a_Random_Function_"></a>With a Random Function<br /></h3>
Another totally different way to draw an approximation of the
Sierpinski Triangle works as follows:<br />
<br />
1) define 3 points with coordinates: a (ax, ay), b (bx, by) and c
(cx, cy). These will become the corners of the large outer
triangle.<br />
<br />
2) define another point, p (px, py) and place it in a corner of the
triangle (for example px = ax and py = ay).<br />
<br />
3) draw a point at location (px, py) with a pencil<br />
<br />
4) roll a theoretical die with 3 sides (side 0, side 1 and side 2),
or just make a random choice between "0", "1" and "2".<br />
<br />
5) now change the coordinates of point p, depending on what number
you rolled:<br />
<ul>
<li>if you rolled 0, p = (p+a) / 2</li>
<li>if you rolled 1, p = (p+b) / 2</li>
<li>if you rolled 2, p = (p+c) / 2</li>
</ul>
6) go back to step 2, there place the point at the new position of
p, and keep looping through this until you get tired<br />
<br />
Even though the whole process is randomized, after enough steps,
the result will look more and more like a Sierpinski
Triangle!<br />
<br />
This isn't too hard to code, the comments explain how everything

<br />
The bigger you make the numSteps value, the more pixels will be
drawn. These images show the result for 1000, 10000 and 100000
steps:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/sier1000.gif" style=

<img alt="" src="images/sier100000.gif" style=
"width: 262px; height: 281px;" /><br />
<br />
By playing a bit with the formulas you can get other shapes, like
for example this one:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/siervar.gif" style=
"width: 262px; height: 281px;" /><br />
<br />
Gotten by changing some of the divisions through 2.0 into divisions
through 3.0.<br />
<h3><a name="sieverec" id="sieverec"></a>With Rectangle
Recursion<br /></h3>
Yet another way to draw a Sierpinski Triangle is with a recursive
function that uses rectangles. The recursion process works as
follows: Change every rectangle into an L-shape:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/sierrect.gif" style=
"width: 344px; height: 109px;" /><br />
<br />
The L-shape itself consists out of 3 rectangles, which are again
converted into an L-shape, etc...<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/sierrect2.gif" style=
"width: 616px; height: 109px;" /><br />
<br />
If you keep doing this long enough, it'll look more and more like a
Sierpinski Triangle. This is again something that can be programmed
with a recursive function, pretty similar to the recursive code
given higher, but this times rectangles are drawn, and new
coordinates for 3 new rectangles have to be calculated every
time.<br />

Here's the result for 3, 5 and 8 recursions:<br />
<br />

<img alt="" src="images/sierrec8.gif" style=

<br />
To study the recursion a bit better, try to see what happens when
the drawSierpinski function calls itself only 1 time instead of 3
(the other 2 calls are commented out): now, if maxRecursions is 8,
only 8 rectangles are drawn, each one smaller than the previous
one:<br />

<br />
Now, we enable two of the calls to itself, and already more squares
are being drawn, but the shape isn't so complex yet. Now on the
right is 1 big square, left of it 2 half squares, left of those 4
1/4th squares, left of that 8 1/8th squares, and so on, with to the
leftmost row 128 squares that are 128 times smaller than the big
square on the right.<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/sierrecvar2.gif" style=
"width: 262px; height: 281px;" /><br />
<br />
And finally, if we enable all 3 calls to itself, we get the
Sierpinski Triangle, and so many squares are drawn that almost
everything is white:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/sierrec8.gif" style=
"width: 260px; height: 280px;" /><br />
<br />
There's even another way to get a Sierpinski Triangle: with a
cellular automaton, but this might be covered in a later
article.<br />

Recursion</h3>
A different fractal is the Sierpinski Carpet. To draw one by hand,
start with a white square, and then draw a black square in the
center with each side 1/3th of the size of the original
square:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/siercardraw1.gif" style=
"width: 243px; height: 243px;" /> <img alt="" src=
"images/siercardraw2.gif" style=
"width: 243px; height: 243px;" /><br />
<br />
Now, around the black square, are 8 white squares. In each of these
8, draw again a black square that is 1/8th smaller, and in the
8*8=64 new white squares, do it yet again:<br />
<br />

"width: 243px; height: 243px;" /> <img alt="" src=
"images/siercardraw4.gif" style=
"width: 243px; height: 243px;" /><br />
<br />
Keep doing this until infinity, and you get a sierpinski
carpet!<br />
<br />
To draw it, we can use a recursive function that's pretty similar
to the one used for the sierpinski triangle with rectangles, but
now the function has to call itself 8 times instead of only 3, and
use different coordinates. The coordinates x1,y1-x2,y2 get divided
in 9 sections, in the center one the rectangle is drawn with rect,
and the other 8 ones are used as parameters for the drawCarpet
calls of the next recursion step.<br />

And here's the result for 6 recursion steps:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/sierpinskicarpet.gif" style=
"width: 249px; height: 268px;" /><br />
<br />
If you want a bigger one, use a resolution of 729*729 pixels and 7
recursions.<br />
<br />
<h3><a name="With_Ternary_Numbers_" id=
"With_Ternary_Numbers_"></a>With Ternary Numbers<br /></h3>
There's also a method to draw the Sierpinski Carpet that's similar
to the "AND" method for drawing the sierpinski triangle. Namely,
you do a calculation for each pixel to check whether or not it
should be colored.<br />
<br />
This method is a bit more complex though, because you have to work
in base 3, i.e. with ternary numbers. Ternary numbers have digits
that can be '0', '1' or '2'.<br />
<br />
The method works as follows:<br />
<br />
Take both the coordinates of the pixel as integers written in
ternary notation. For every digit, check if NOT both corresponding
digits are '1'. If this never happens, then the point belongs to
the carpet.<br />
<br />
To find the first (rightmost) ternary digit of a number, modulo
divide it though 3 (modulo division through 3 works as follows:
0%3=0, 1%3=1, 2%3=2, 3%3=0, 4%3=1, 5%3=2, 6%3=0, 7%3=1,
etc.....).<br />
To find the second ternary digit, first divide the number through 3
(integer division, i.e. remove the numbers behind the point), and
then modulo divide it though 3.<br />
To find the third ternary digit, divide it through 9, then modulo
divide through 3.<br />
To find the fourth, divide through 27, then modulo divide through
3,<br />
etc...<br />
<br />
The example below uses a resolution of 243 by 243 pixels, so we
have to check only the first 5 ternary digits of the pixel
coordinates, since with 5 ternary digits you can represent all
numbers from 0 to 242.<br />
<br />
The condition in the "if", is written out on many lines, and the
condition checks for each of the 5 digits if NOT both the one from
the x coordinate and the one from the y coordinate are together 1.
If the condition is true, a white pixel is drawn at x,y.<br />

<br />
The result looks exactly the same as from the previous program,
even though this one uses a totally different method:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/sierpinskicarpetter.gif" style=
"width: 248px; height: 268px;" /><br />
<br />
If you want to increase the resolution, you have to add an extra
condition for the 6th digit (where you divide through 243), etc...
for every time you triple the resolution.<br />
<br />
The condition that checks for the 5th digit (the 5th ternary digit
from the right) is the one that's responsible for the big black
square in the center.<br />
The condition that checks for the 4th digit, is the one responsible
for the 8 smaller squares around the center square,<br />
etc...<br />
<br />
If you remove the condition for the 5th digit, the center black
square is gone, and instead you get this:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/siercarvar.gif" style=
"width: 249px; height: 267px;" /><br />
<br />
If you remove instead for example the condition that checks for the
3th digit, all the black squares of the third order are gone while
all others are left:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/siercarvar2.gif" style=
"width: 249px; height: 268px;" /><br />
<br />
So if you triple the resolution, the square that is now the center
square will become a square in the top left, and you need an even
bigger black square in the new center, which is why you need a new
condition that checks for the 6th digit then.<br />
