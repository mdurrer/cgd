<h2><a name="Introduction_" id=

One of those cool effects used in oldskool demos is the Tunnel
Effect. This effect shows a tunnel in which you fly while the
tunnel rotates, seemingly in 3D. This tutorial will explain how to
make one.<br />
<br />
<h2><a name="How_it_works" id="How_it_works"></a>How it
works<br /></h2>
An example tunnel looks like this, only in reality it
animates:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/tunnelxor.jpg" style=
"width: 320px; height: 240px;" /><br />
<br />
The effect works as follows:<br />
<br />
First, you need a texture, which is the texture of the sides of the
tunnel.<br />
<br />
The animation of the tunnel actually isn't calculated on the fly
while the animation runs, but it's precalculated. These
calculations are stored in two tables: one for the angle and one
for the distance.<br />
<br />
The distance table contains for every pixel of the screen, the
inverse of the distance to the center of the screen this pixel has.
This gives pixels of the center of the screen a very high value
(those are very far away, as you can see on the picture above),
while the pixels on the sides of the screen get a low value (these
pixels represent parts of the tunnel close to the camera).<br />
<br />
The angle table contains the angle of every pixel of the screen,
where the center of the screen represents the origin.<br />
<br />
Then after everything is precalculated the animation loop starts.
This animation loop goes every frame, through every pixel (x,y),
and then uses the angle and distance table to ask which texel of
the texture it should draw at the current pixel. And, to get the
animation, the values of the angle and distance table are shifted:
shifting the angle table makes the tunnel rotate, while shifting
the distance table makes you move forwards or backwards.<br />
<br />
The texture has only a finite size, while the values gotten by the
distance go up to infinity, and the values of the angle are
periodic. When a value outside the texture is asked, modulo divide
it through the size of the texture, this way we get the texture
repeated over and over (but always smaller as it's closer to the
center of the screen). You'll see this much better in the
code.<br />
<br />
<h2><a name="The_code" id="The_code"></a>The code</h2>
This code creates a tunnel where you fly forward while the tunnel
rotates, and the center of the tunnel always remains in the center
of the screen. The code is made so that no matter what size the
texture has, the effect will always have the same speed, and the
texture is as big on the screen.<br />
<br />
Here a few values are defined and buffers are created.<br />
<br />
The texture array is the texture (duh). The bigger it's size, the
better the effect, I recommend making it at least 256*256 pixels,
because it'll be as big as the screen, and the rotation goes very
shaky if the texture is too small.<br />
<br />
The distanceTable is the precalculated table for the inverse
distance of every pixel, and the angleTable is the precalculated
angle of every pixel. These have to be at least as big as the
screen, but if you also want to move the center of the tunnel
around on the screen, you'll have to make them bigger.<br />
<br />
And the buffer array is used to draw the pixels to, so that the
whole screen buffer can be drawn at once instead of using pset for
every separate pixel.<br />
<br />
<center>
<table class="codetable">
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">
<pre><span class="code">#define texWidth 256
#define texHeight 256
#define screenWidth 640
#define screenHeight 480

int texture[texWidth][texHeight];

int distanceTable[screenWidth][screenHeight];
int angleTable[screenWidth][screenHeight];
int buffer[screenWidth][screenHeight];</span></pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<br />
Here the main function starts, and a blue XOR texture is generated
(you can also load one from a bitmap instead).<br />
<br />
<center>
<table class="codetable">
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">
<pre><span class="code">int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    screen(screenWidth, screenHeight, 0, <span class=
"string">"Tunnel Effect"</span>);
    
    <span class="comment">//generate texture</span>
    for(int x = 0; x &lt; texWidth; x++)
    for(int y = 0; y &lt; texHeight; y++)
    {
        texture[x][y] = (x * 256 / texWidth) ^ (y * 256 / texHeight);
    }</span></pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<br />
Next the buffers are generated. The distance buffer uses the
formula of the inverse distance to the center of the screen (in
2D), multiplied by texHeight so that no matter which size the
texture has, it's always as big. It's also modulo divided through
texHeight so that the same texture is repeated all the time over
the whole distance.<br />
<br />
The angle buffer calculates the angle of the current pixel (the
angle it has to the pixel in the center of the screen), by using
the atan2 function. The atan2 function belongs to the &lt;cmath&gt;
header, and returns the angle in radians of a given point by giving
it's x and y coordinate. It's divided through pi, so that the
texture will be wrapped exactly one time around the tunnel.<br />
<br />
The ratio variable is the ratio between the width and height the
texture will be having on screen, or how long the texture stretches
out in the distance.<br />
<br />
<center>
<table class="codetable">
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">
<pre><span class="code">    <span class="comment">//generate non-linear transformation table</span>
    for(int x = 0; x &lt; w; x++)
    for(int y = 0; y &lt; h; y++)
    {
        int angle, distance;
        float ratio = 32.0;
        distance = int(ratio * texHeight / sqrt((x - w / 2.0) * (x - w / 2.0) + (y - h / 2.0) * (y - h / 2.0))) % texHeight;
        angle = (unsigned int)(0.5 * texWidth * atan2(y - h / 2.0, x - w / 2.0) / 3.1416);
        distanceTable[x][y] = distance;
        angleTable[x][y] = angle;
    }</span></pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<br />
Then the animation loop starts.<br />
<br />
The animation variable is set to the time in seconds, and will be
used for shifting the tables for rotation and the moving.<br />
<br />
Then for every pixel (x,y), the correct texel is gotten from the
texture by using the tables, and shifted with the animation value.
The modulo division through the width and height of the texture are
to make sure we won't ask for a pixel outside the texture, but use
the same texture tiled instead. Unsigned integers are used, because
the values can become negative, and the modulo division only works
correctly if they're unsigned instead, so that negative numbers
will wrap around. Because of this, the texture width and height
should be powers of 2, or they won't nicely tile. The animation
values (shiftX and shiftY) are multiplied with the texture width
and height to make the speed of the effect independent of the
texture size, only of the time.<br />
<br />
The animation of the distance and angle is also multiplied with a
constant value (1.0 and 0.25 here), by changing these you can
independently change the speed of the rotation, and of the moving
forward.<br />
<br />
The pixels of the screen are drawn to the buffer, and after all
pixels are drawn, the buffer is put on screen, and the process
restarts again for the next frame.<br />

<h2><a name="Looking_Around" id="Looking_Around"></a>Looking
Around</h2>
Because you keep moving forward all the time, the effect becomes
boring fast. To make it a bit more interesting, the camera can be
made to look around. To do this, simply move the center of the
tunnel around, it then seems as if the camera rotates. If you want
to move the center of the tunnel around, bigger precalculated
buffers are needed. Here's a modified version of the code that'll
do this. The bold parts are new or changed, and the comments should
explain it.<br />

<br />
Here for example it's looking to the bottom left, so the center of
the tunnel is in the top right of the screen, but the looking
direction changes all the time while the effect runs:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/tunnellook.jpg" style=
"width: 404px; height: 323px;" /><br />
<br />
If you're interested, because two sine functions are used to look
around, one for the looking in the x direction, and one for the
looking in the y direction, the look-around movement (or the path
the center of the tunnel follows on the screen) has the shape of a
Lissajous figure.<br />
