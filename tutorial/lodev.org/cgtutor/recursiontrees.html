<h2><a name="Introduction" id="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
Fractals have the property of self-similarity. One type of figure
that fulfills this requirement, are Recursion Trees. The idea is as
follows: you draw the stem of the tree, then the stem splits into
two smaller branches, each of these two branches again splits into
two smaller branches, etc... until infinity.<br />
<h2><a name="Recursion_Tree_with_Two_Branches" id=
"Recursion_Tree_with_Two_Branches"></a>Recursion Tree with Two
Branches</h2>
To code such a recursion tree, we need of course a recursive
function. This function will draw one branch, and call itself again
to draw two new branches, and since it has called itself again,
these two called versions will again call itself again, etc... The
parameters are changed each time to draw the branch at the correct
position, with the correct angle and size. There's also a stop
condition, it'll stop after n recursions, otherwise the calculation
would never be finished and it'd end up in an infinite loop. In the
nth step of recursion, 2^n branches have to be drawn.<br />
<br />
First, some variables and the recursive function are declared. "pi"
can be used to give your favorite angle in radians more easily.
"maxRecursions" is for the stop condition of the recursive
functions. "angle" is a constant, it's the angle each new branch
will have compared to it's parent branch. "shrink" is how much
smaller each new branch is compared to it's parent branch. You can
change their values, the values here have been chosen to give one
of the many possible nice results.<br />
<br />

<table class="codetable">

<td style="vertical-align: top;">
<pre><span class="code">double pi = 3.1415926535897932384626433832795;

<br />
The main function doesn't do much more than setting up the screen,
and then calling the recursive function. The value "h/2.3" in the
parameters of the recursion function is the initial length of the
first branch (the stem). The coordinates are the begin point and
direction vector of the first branch.<br />
<br />
<center>
<table class="codetable">
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">
<pre><span class="code">int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    screen(320, 240, 0, <span class="string">"Recursion Tree"</span>);
    cls(RGB_White); <span class="comment">//make background white</span>

    <span class="comment">//Now the recursion function takes care of the rest</span>
    recursion(w / 2, h - 1, 0, -1, h / 2.3, 0);
    
    redraw();
    sleep();
    return 0;
}</span></pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<br />
Now follows the recursion function, a function that only draws a
single line and calls itself a few times, but results in a huge
tree!<br />
<br />
Here's the part that draws the line. First the line is clipped to
the screen, then drawn. The line is drawn from (posX, posY) to
(posX+dirX, posY+dirY). So the position and direction of the line
is given as a vector, instead of a begin point, an angle and a
size, because direction vectors are much easier to work with. The
size parameter itself isn't used to draw the line directly, it's
only needed later to calculate the direction vector of the next
branches. If the maximum number of recursions is needed, the
function returns immediately after drawing the line, without
calling itself again.<br />
<br />
<center>
<table class="codetable">
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">
<pre><span class="code">void recursion(double posX, double posY, double dirX, double dirY, double size, int n)
{
    int x1, x2, y1, y2;
    int x3, x4, y3, y4;
    x1 = int(posX);
    y1 = int(posY);
    x2 = int(posX + size * dirX);
    y2 = int(posY + size * dirY);
    if(clipLine(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4))
    drawLine(x3, y3, x4, y4, ColorRGB(128, 96, 64));

    if(n &gt;= maxRecursions) return;</span></pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<br />
And in the second part of the function, the new position of the new
branches is calculated as the endpoint of the previous branch, and
the new direction vector for the new branches is calculated out of
the size and current direction of the current branch. The new
branches are rotated with the angle, the sine and cosine formulas
are actually the calculation of the rotation matrix. Then the
recursion function is called again with the new branch in it's
parameters. This is done twice: once for a branch rotated to the
right, and then for a branch rotated to the left.<br />
<br />
<center>
<table class="codetable">
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">
<pre><span class="code">    double posX2, posY2, dirX2, dirY2, size2;
    int n2;
    posX2 = posX + size * dirX;
    posY2 = posY + size * dirY;
    size2 = size / shrink;
    n2 = n + 1;
    dirX2 = cos(angle) * dirX + sin(angle) * dirY;
    dirY2 = -sin(angle) * dirX + cos(angle) * dirY;
    recursion(posX2, posY2, dirX2, dirY2, size2, n2);
    dirX2 = cos(-angle) * dirX + sin(-angle) * dirY;
    dirY2 = -sin(-angle) * dirX + cos(-angle) * dirY;
    recursion(posX2, posY2, dirX2, dirY2, size2, n2);
}</span></pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<br />
The result looks like this:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/recursiontree1.gif" style=
"width: 324px; height: 263px;" /><br />
<br />
It's very easy to make the screen bigger, just change the
parameters in the screen function, all the rest of the code is made
relative to the size of the screen.<br />
<br />
Here's an alternative main function, that will redraw the tree all
the time with a different angle.<br />
<br />
<center>
<table class="codetable">
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">
<pre><span class="code">int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    screen(320, 240, 0, <span class="string">"Recursion Tree"</span>);
    while(!done())
    {
        angle = getTicks() / 2000.0;
        cls(RGB_White);
        recursion(w / 2, h - 1, 0, -1, h / 2.3, 0);
        redraw();
    }
    return 0;
}</span></pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<br />
The angle is set to the time divided through some factor
determining the speed of the animation. Here are a few of the
results you get for different angles:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/recursiontree2.gif" style="width: 75px; height: 237px;" />
<img alt="" src="images/recursiontree3.gif" style="width: 240px; height: 208px;" /> <img alt="" src="images/recursiontree4.gif" style="width: 204px; height: 167px;" />
<img alt="" src="images/recursiontree5.gif" style="width: 142px; height: 126px;" /><br />
<h2><a name="Recursion_Tree_with_More_Branches" id="Recursion_Tree_with_More_Branches"></a>Recursion Tree with MoreBranches</h2>
Instead of only 2 branches, you can also give it more branches of
course. For example, to give it 3 branches, let the recursive
function call itself 3 times instead of only 2. This gives a huge
increase in complexity however: now, if n is the max number of
recursions, the number of branches to draw will be 3^n only in the
last step, so if n=8, that's 6561 branches!<br />
<br />
It isn't difficult to extend to 3 or more branches, you just have
to choose a nice angle for the new branches. The following code
also has something extra: at the end of each branch, a green circle
will be painted, making it look like leaves. It also allows to turn
on or off&nbsp; up to 4 branches separately, and give each branch a
fixed or time varying angle. In the main function are different
input keys that create different angles and settings.<br />
<br />
Everything is declared again, the explanation of each variable is
in the comments. The angle of branch i will be angle*ai+ci, where
angle varies with the time.<br />

In the main function, some initial parameters are set, and then the
while loop starts. This while loop will draw the tree each time and
change the angle a with the time.<br />

The second part of the loop changes the settings like the angles,
the number of recursions, ... according to some presets. It's easy
to change them or add more if you like. The releaseSpace variable
is used for the space key: it's there so that if you press the
space key, it'll only change the setting again after you released
the space key again.<br />

The recursion function is extended a bit too now:<br />
<br />
First it'll clip and draw the line of the branch, and then, if the
last recursion is reached, it'll draw a leave. Which type of leave
it draws depends on the drawLeaves setting, that can be changed
with the space key. If the max number of recursions is reached, the
function returns so that it doesn't call itself anymore.<br />

Here are just a few of the trees that can be generated this
way:<br />
<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/recursiontree6.gif" style=
"width: 429px; height: 381px;" /> <img alt="" src=
"images/recursiontree7.gif" style=
"width: 509px; height: 381px;" /><br />
<br />
You can do much more with this to create very natural trees, for
example you can randomize the angle each recursion, or randomize
whether or not a next branch will be drawn. You can draw thicker
stems, with a texture, and nicer leaves instead, or even extend
this to 3D and make some nice OpenGL demo! Use your fantasy
:)<br />
