BIG TOPICS:
+Rendering Engine
-Physics Engine

Other topics:
+Some way to insert game into engine
+Better scratchpad support
-Better textures (reading, blitting, basic image processing)
+Some way to separate game and engine data
+Add higher level rendering constructs (Shaders, Materials, Meshes, Transforms)
+Add some form of automatic shader selection
-Add some form of primitives (Rectangles, Spheres)
+More flexible transform class (default values for projection and camera)
=Non-perspective views, (orthogonal views)
-Texture manipulation (Translation, rotation, scale)
-More Control over textures (Filtering, Formatting)
+More friendly constructors
=Window should have more properties (Center position, fullscreen, maybe mouse locking)
=Better vector math (normalization, +=, Commonly used Vector constants, Swizzling support)
-Options class/system, some place to read values that the player chooses
+Centralized "level" or "scene" class that holds the data the game is using
+Game object class
+Make all positioning names "position"
+Make naming more consistent
+Vector swizzling
+Make all time based on seconds rather than nanoseconds
+Change the way delta is passed
+Give vectors a copy constructor
+Give vectors an interpolation method
-Transparency Support
-Sprite Support
+Good way to compare vectors
+Vector2f cross product
-Some way to display text

-Eventually, make easier way to generate mesh
-Eventually, make easy way of generating texture coordinates
