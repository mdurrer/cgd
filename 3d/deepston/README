Deepstone (unfinished)

This would/will be a dungeon crawler if I ever finish it.

Usage
-----
Just start it, walk around with WASD and look around by moving the mouse.
Nothing else to do at the moment :)

Precompiled binaries included in the archive:
 * deepston.exe          MS-DOS version (32bit, requires included dos4gw.exe)
 * deepstone-win32.exe   32bit Windows version
 * deepstone-linux32     32bit GNU/Linux version
 * deepstone-linux64     64bit GNU/Linux version

The GNU/Linux binaries require libSDL which depends on a shitload of libraries
on my system, so you probably won't be able to run it without first installing
all the dependencies. It might be easier to just compile it yourself, just type
make and run ./deepstone

Running with DOSBOX
-------------------
I've included a dosbox.conf which automatically runs the "game", as well as a
copy of dosbox.exe for windows. So just change into the dosbox/ subdirectory and
run dosbox.
NOTE: you might need to click in the dosbox window first before you can use
mouse control.

Running on actual MS-DOS
------------------------
Just copy deepston.exe, dos4gw.exe and the data directory to your DOS machine,
and run it. The mouse driver must be installed first! (mouse.com or whatever).

Build on MS-DOS
---------------
 * You need the Watcom 32bit compiler and assorted utilities.
 * Type make
 * Profit (run deepston.exe)

Build on GNU/Linux
------------------
 * Install SDL (libsdl-1.2-dev or whatever).
 * Type make
 * Profit (run ./deepstone)

Build on MS-Windows
-------------------
 * Install SDL
 * Open deepstone.sln with visual studio >= 2008
 * Make sure visual studio knows where to find your copy of SDL (so configure
   include and library paths... ugh, windows programming.. icky).
 * Press build solution or whatever it's called this way.
 * Profit (find the bloody thing and run it, or click the happy little play button).
